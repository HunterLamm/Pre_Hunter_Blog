<h3 id="acting-humanly-the-turing-test-approach">1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach</h3>
<p><strong>Turing Test:</strong> provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence.</p>
<p>A computer which can pass through a rigorously test need the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>natural language:</strong> communicating successfully in English.</li>
<li><strong>knowledge representation:</strong> store what it knows or hears.</li>
<li><strong>automated reasoning:</strong> use the stored information to answer questions and draw new conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>machine learning:</strong> adapt to new circumstances and detect patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total Turing Test:</strong> using video signal and physical simulation of a person to interact with the computer.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-humanly-the-cognitive-modeling-approach">1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach</h3>
<p>In order to know how program can think like human, we need to find out how humans think.</p>
<p>There are three ways to get inside the actual working of human minds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>introspection:</strong> try to catch our own thoughts as they go by.</li>
<li><strong>psychological experiments:</strong> observe a person in action.</li>
<li><strong>brain imaging:</strong> observe the brain in action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thinking-rationally-the-laws-of-thought-approach">1.1.3 Thinking rationally: The &quot;laws of thought&quot; approach</h3>
<p><strong>syllogisms:</strong> patterns of argument structures. Ex: &quot;Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal.&quot;</p>
<p>1965, programs existed which could solve any solvable problem described in logical notation.</p>
<p>There are two main obstacles to build a intelligent systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms require by logical notation.</li>
<li>computer will exhaust all the computational resources even their only a few hundred facts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acting-rationally-the-rational-agent-approach">1.1.4 Acting rationally: The rational agent approach</h3>
<p><strong>agent:</strong> acts(<em>agent</em> comes from Latin <em>agere</em>)</p>
<p><strong>rational agent:</strong> acts so achieve the best outcome or the best expected outcome.</p>
<p>Correct inference is not all of rationality. There are ways of acting rationally that cannot be said to involve inference. Ex: recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action that is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.</p>
<p>The rational-agent approach has two advantages over the other approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>more general because correct inference is just one of several possible mechanisms for achieving rationality.</li>
<li>more amenable to scientific development. The standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and completely general.</li>
</ul>
<p>So much computational is demanded if we want to achieving perfect rationality. However, we will start working hypothesis that perfect rationality to analysis problems. Hence, we can simplifies the problems and provide the appropriate setting for most of the foundational material in the field.</p>
<h2 id="the-foundations-of-artificial-intelligence">1.2 The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<h3 id="philosophy">1.2.1 Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?</li>
<li>How does the mind arise from a physical brain?</li>
<li>Where does knowledge com from?</li>
<li>How does knowledge lead to action?</li>
</ul>
<p>Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) was the first person who formulate a precise set of laws governing the rational part of the mind. He developed an <strong>informal system of syllogisms</strong> for proper reasoning that mainly can allow one to generate conclusions mechanically with given initial premises. The first known calculating machine was constructed around 1623 by the German scientist Wilhelm Schickard (1592-1635). Some stated that machines might not just do calculations but actually be able to think and act on their own.</p>
<p>Some people consider mind as a <strong>physical system</strong>. One problem with a purely physical conception of the mind is that if a mind is fully physical laws, everything is decided by the law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rationalism:</strong> believe a concept, power of reasoning in understanding the world, which is proposed by Descartes.</li>
<li><strong>dualism:</strong> there is a part of human mind that is exempt from physical laws.</li>
<li><strong>materialism:</strong> brain's operation according to the laws of physics constitutes the mind. Free will is the way that the perception of available choices appears to the choosing entity.</li>
<li><strong>empiricism:</strong> everything is first in the senses. <strong>principle of induction:</strong> that general rules are acquired by exposure to repeated associations between their elements.</li>
<li><strong>logical positivism:</strong> doctrine holds that all knowledge can be characterized by logical theories connected to <strong>observation sentences</strong> that correspond to sensory inputs, which is proposed by Vienna Circle. logical positivism is a combination of rationalism and empiricism.</li>
<li><strong>confirmation theory:</strong> analyze the acquisition of knowledge from experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final element in the philosophical picture of the mind is the connection between knowledge and action. It is important for AI because intelligence requires action as well as reasoning.</p>
<h3 id="mathematics">1.2.2 Mathematics</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?</li>
<li>What can be computed?</li>
<li>How do reason with uncertain information?</li>
</ul>
<p>Formal science required a level of mathematical formalization in three fundamental areas: <strong>logic</strong>, <strong>computation</strong>, <strong>probability</strong>.</p>
<p>The first <strong>algorithm</strong> is thought to be Euclid's algorithm for computing greatest common divisors. The world algorithm comes from al-Khowarazmi, a Persian mathematician of the 9th century. In 1931, Gödel showed that limits on deduction do exist. His <strong>incompleteness theorem</strong> showed that in any formal theory, there are true statements that are undecidable in the sense that they have no proof within the theory. This theory means some functions on the integers cannot be represented by an algorithm, which mean they cannot be computed. According to Church-Turing thesis, which states that the Turing machine is capable of computing any computable function, is generally accepted as providing a sufficient definition.</p>
<p><strong>Tractability</strong> has an greater impact than computation. Roughly speaking, a problem is called intractable if the time required to solve instances of the problem grows exponentially in complexity was first emphasized in the mid-1960s. The theory of <strong>NP-completeness</strong>, pioneered by Steven Cook and Richard Karp, provides a method that can recognize an intractable problem. Cook and Karp showed the existence of large classes of canonical combinatorial search and reasoning problems that are NP-complete. Any problem class to which the class of NP-complete problems can be reduced is likely to be intractable.</p>
<p>Besides logic and computation, the third great contribution of mathematics of AI is the theory of <strong>probability</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="economics">1.2.3 Economics</h3>
<ul>
<li>How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?</li>
<li>How should we do this when others may not go along?</li>
<li>How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the ffuture?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decision theory:</strong> combines probability theory with utility theory, provides a formal and complete framework for decision made under uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>for &quot;large&quot; economies: agent need pay no attention to the actions of other agents as individuals.</li>
<li>for &quot;small&quot; economies: situation is more like a <strong>game:</strong> the actions of one player can significantly affect the utility of another.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>operations research:</strong> scientific process of transforming data into insights to making better decisions. It contributed much to rational agents.</p>
<p><strong>Markov decision processes:</strong> a class of sequential decision problems.</p>
<h3 id="neuroscience">1.2.4 Neuroscience</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do brains process information?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Neuroscience:</strong> study of nervous system.</p>
<p>In 1861, it was known that the brain consisted of <strong>neurons</strong>.</p>
<p>Brains and digital computers have different properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>computers have a cycle time that is million times faster than a brain.</li>
<li>brain makes up for that with far more storage and interconnection than computer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="psychology">1.2.5 Psychology</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do humans and animals think and act?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cognitive psychology:</strong> views the brain as an information-processing device.</p>
<p>Three key steps of a knowledge-based agent:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the stimulus must be translated into a internal representation.</li>
<li>the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive new internal representation.</li>
<li>these are in turn retranslated back into action.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="computer-engineering">1.2.6 Computer engineering</h3>
<ul>
<li>How can we build an efficient computer?</li>
</ul>
<p>operating systems, programming languages, and tools needed to write modern programs make AI become possible. AI also has pioneered many ideas that have made their way back to mainstream computer science.</p>
<h3 id="control-theory-and-cybernetics">1.2.7 Control theory and cybernetics</h3>
<ul>
<li>How can artifacts operate under their own control?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>control theory:</strong> modify behavior by itself in response to changes in the environment.</p>
<p><strong>modern control theory (especially stochastic optimal control):</strong> design of systems that maximize an <strong>objective function</strong> over time.</p>
<p>modern control theory matches our view of AI: designing systems that behave optimally.</p>
<h3 id="linguistics">1.2.8 Linguistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>How does language relate to thought?</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern linguistics and AI intersect in a hybrid field called <strong>computational linguistics</strong> or <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong>.</p>

    <title>Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)</title>
    <url>/2021/09/26/Longest-Increasing-Subsequence-LIS/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="longest-increasing-subsequence-lis">Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)</h1>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Given a sequence, fin the length of the longest subsequence that all elements in the subsequence is increasing.</p>
<p>For example, given a sequence as follow:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{llllllllllll}
4 &amp; 10 &amp; 15 &amp; 7 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 8 &amp; 15 &amp; 17
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>The answer of this sequence is 6. This subsequence is: 4 7 8 9 15 17.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Let's think about the brute-force solution. For each elements we have two choices: use it or not. Thus, if we use the brute-force solution the time complexity at least <strong>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</strong>​​​</p>
<p>Commonly speaking, the size of n will larger than 1000. It is a tremendous amount of calculation for computer. Therefore, we have to find out better way to solve it.</p>
<p>We are going to use <strong>Dynamic Programming (DP)</strong> to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The first step is to define this question by a function. Let's set <strong>f(x)</strong> means all collection of subsequence ending with the <strong>x<sub>th</sub></strong> element.</p>
<p>The second step is to find out a meaning for the function. Each value in the function has its own meaning. In this question we are finding the longest length of subsequence; thus, we can set the meaning for each value of <strong>f(x) </strong>to be <strong>maximum</strong>. <strong>f(x)</strong> represents the longest length of subsequence which is ending with the <strong>x<sub>th</sub></strong> element.</p>
<p>Next step is to find out how we can solve this function. This is the most important part in DP. Let's assume us have the value of <strong>f(0)</strong> to <strong>f(i-1)</strong>. How can we get the value of <strong>f(i)</strong>? Every subsequence ending with the element that is before <strong>i<sub>th</sub></strong> element and smaller than <strong>i<sub>th</sub></strong> element can add the <strong>i<sub>th</sub></strong> element into the end of subsequence. Hence, we can get the equation as follow:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(i)=\max (f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(i-1))+1
\]</span></p>
<p>The code written in C++ as follow:</p>
<figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="title">solve</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">int</span> length,<span class="keyword">int</span> nums[])</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i=<span class="number">0</span>;i&lt;length;i++)</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> j=<span class="number">0</span>;j&lt;i;j++)</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">if</span>(nums[i]&gt;nums[j])</span><br><span class="line">                f[i] = <span class="built_in">max</span>(f[i],f[j]+<span class="number">1</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">int</span> rst = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i=<span class="number">0</span>;i&lt;length;i++) rst = <span class="built_in">max</span>(rst,f[i]);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> rst;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
